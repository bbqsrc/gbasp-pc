= Configuration bits for 16F627A =

So you're burning the picps2 nonsense to a PIC. You say "oi, what settings does the twat that wrote it recommend for I care little for specifics but I do want to screw with the chip quite a bit." Well sir/madam, here are the recommended defaults to receive correct functionality (or so I seem to believe).

CONFIG:
0b001011100
- CPD off
- LVP off
- BOREN on
- MCLRE off
- PWRTE off
- WDTE on 
- FOSC INTOSC OSC, I/O on RA6 and RA7
